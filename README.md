# ESA Predictions

This is a prototype for an API that will be used to store and show user predictions for runs.

## Getting started

### Development

You need a recent version of Node (with NPM) installed in order to run this project.

1. run `npm install` in the root of the repo
2. run `npm start` in the root of the repo to start up the development server.
3. you can now edit the files in the `src` folder and it should automatically update the server when you save the files.

### Running in production

You can build the project for production using the command `npm build` and later execute `node build/index.js` to start the production server. (Or better yet use PM2 to run it).
